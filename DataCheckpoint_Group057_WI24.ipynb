    "Standardized tests can act as a lens through which educators and policymakers can understand various aspects of the educational system, identifying both strengths and areas in need of improvement. Analyzing standardized test results alongside teacher credentials, resource allocation, and instructional strategies provides a comprehensive view of the educational environment, fostering efforts to improve student achievement and success. The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act mandated that schools employ qualified educators who are certified in their state, hold a bachelor's degree, and demonstrate subject knowledge. <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-3) With the replacement of NCLB by the Every Child Succeeds Act (ECSA) in 2015, schools, or Local Education Agencies, are now obligated to report on the qualifications of educators, including the percentage of 'inexperienced' teachers. <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-3) \n",

    "Numerous research papers have explored the influence of libraries on individual students' educational attainment. Across the three initial research sources we examined, student success was measured and defined using metrics such as GPAs, retention rates, and qualitative interviews, shedding light on students' perspectives regarding the significance of public libraries in their academic journey. Just as GPA and retention rates provide insights, CAASPP test scores in ELA and mathematics offer pathways to explore the connection between public library utilization and measurable academic achievement. While standardized testing is not the sole dependable method for gauging student progress, it remains commonly utilized to assess college readiness and academic advancement. \n",
    "\n",
    "The literature asserts that public libraries serve as invaluable resources for students from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, offering access to a wide range of written, verbal, and digital materials. For students lacking reliable technology, libraries provide a conducive environment for studying, asking questions, and engaging in group activities, all within a quiet and secure setting. Meanwhile, school librarians act as threads, linking students and teachers to reliable, consistently accurate instruction. Libraries not only supply tangible resources to all community members but can also serve as academic equalizers for low-income students and students of color. A study conducted on Australian public libraries' impact on students living in regional or remote locations found that these students benefited significantly from utilizing library resources.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-2) This was attributed to their access to qualified and informed assistance from librarians, as well as the diversity of materials available in libraries. A study conducted at Northern Colorado University from fall 2017 to spring 2018 revealed that a higher proportion of students of color and those eligible for Pell grants utilized library resources compared to their white or non-eligible counterparts.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-1) The Northern Colorado University study posed several empirical questions related to student success, which could be investigated using the metrics mentioned earlier. Questions include: “How does the use of specific library services correlate with persistence for undergraduate students?” and, “Is there a positive correlation between the number of uses of library services and academic achievement for undergraduate students?”. <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-1) \n",

    "We hypothesize that California counties with higher rates of activity and participation in public libraries correlate positively with higher CAASPP (California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress) test scores in both ELA and mathematics. Children who regularly visit libraries  have more exposure to reading, routine studying, tutoring, and community events that are often held by libraries. We hypothesize that this would result in those children having stronger reading comprehension and understanding of other skills that lead to them scoring higher on California standardized tests than those who don’t."

    "The most important variables we will use to determine the rate of school-aged children’s activity in libraries are Children Borrowers and Circulation of Children’s Materials. Children borrowers are those who are registered with the library with a child/youth library card, but specific age can vary by library system. Circulation of Children’s Materials refers to the total circulation (including renewals) of cataloged and uncataloged materials (in all formats) marked as Children's, whether they are borrowed by a child, young adult, or adult over the course of the report year. We will calculate the borrowers and circulation per 1,000 children in the county using the population of children in each county using Dataset #3 (see below).\n",

We will be using data from grades 3 through 8, excluding grade 11 because the age range falls outside the Children Borrowers’ age range from the Library dataset.

The CAASPP website provides definitions of what each standard level means and how the percentages met were calculated on [this](https://caaspp-elpac.ets.org/caaspp/UnderstandingSBResults#am1) page and how the Mean Scale Score was calculated and what the ranges for each grade is [here](https://caaspp-elpac.ets.org/caaspp/ScaleScoreRangesSB).\n",

    "The ideal data we have proposed is likely to produce some ethics and privacy concerns. Given our research question, one of the primary concerns we have regards the privacy of the children whose data we will be collecting. The data we wish to utilize will track participation at public libraries as well as student test scores. We understand that while parents or guardians may have consented to allow the collection of their children's data, it is unlikely that the children themselves can offer truly informed consent to have their data collected and used. For this reason, we propose to utilize only data that refrains from including all personal identifying information except for the age of children. Additionally, in our analysis, we aim to only use this data in aggregate — never singling out a single data point for commentary on that individual. Another privacy concern hinges on the fact that some of our data includes attendance rates for children's programs at public libraries. To protect the privacy and safety of the children who attend these programs, we will withhold information about the times and locations of the programs as well as consider only using the program data in aggregate by county. Lastly, considering that these libraries are public institutions, the data must be safeguarded through strong security measures to prevent hacking, data leaks, and other security breaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ethics concerns we have for our data, however, extend beyond just privacy. One issue that might arise from the data is the stigmatization of certain communities or school systems. Since we include performance data on standardized tests as well as library attendance habits, viewers may interpret these as metrics to profile certain groups or communities. In addition, inherent biases can impact the validity and fairness of research findings, which may result in overrepresentation or underrepresentation of particular demographics and socioeconomic groups. Lastly, when collecting data within communities, it is imperative to implement responsible measures and practices that leave the community feeling safe and at ease. It is important in our analysis to remind readers that standardized test scores are not a holistic measure of an individual's capabilities nor is library attendance an accurate means to assess a community's habits."
