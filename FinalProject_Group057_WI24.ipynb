    "Standardized tests can act as a lens through which educators and policymakers can understand various aspects of the educational system, identifying both strengths and areas in need of improvement. Analyzing standardized test results alongside teacher credentials, resource allocation, and instructional strategies provides a comprehensive view of the educational environment, fostering efforts to improve student achievement and success. The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act mandated that schools employ qualified educators who are certified in their state, hold a bachelor's degree, and demonstrate subject knowledge. <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-3) With the replacement of NCLB by the Every Child Succeeds Act (ECSA) in 2015, schools, or Local Education Agencies, are now obligated to report on the qualifications of educators, including the percentage of 'inexperienced' teachers. <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-3) \n",
    "\n",
    "Numerous research papers have explored the influence of libraries on individual students' educational attainment. Across the three initial research sources we examined, student success was measured and defined using metrics such as GPAs, retention rates, and qualitative interviews, shedding light on students' perspectives regarding the significance of public libraries in their academic journey. Just as GPA and retention rates provide insights, CAASPP test scores in ELA and mathematics offer pathways to explore the connection between public library utilization and measurable academic achievement. While standardized testing is not the sole dependable method for gauging student progress, it remains commonly utilized to assess college readiness and academic advancement. \n",
    "\n",
    "The literature asserts that public libraries serve as invaluable resources for students from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, offering access to a wide range of written, verbal, and digital materials. For students lacking reliable technology, libraries provide a conducive environment for studying, asking questions, and engaging in group activities, all within a quiet and secure setting. Meanwhile, school librarians act as threads, linking students and teachers to reliable, consistently accurate instruction. Libraries not only supply tangible resources to all community members but can also serve as academic equalizers for low-income students and students of color. A study conducted on Australian public libraries' impact on students living in regional or remote locations found that these students benefited significantly from utilizing library resources.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-2) This was attributed to their access to qualified and informed assistance from librarians, as well as the diversity of materials available in libraries. A study conducted at Northern Colorado University from fall 2017 to spring 2018 revealed that a higher proportion of students of color and those eligible for Pell grants utilized library resources compared to their white or non-eligible counterparts.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-1) The Northern Colorado University study posed several empirical questions related to student success, which could be investigated using the metrics mentioned earlier. Questions include: “How does the use of specific library services correlate with persistence for undergraduate students?” and, “Is there a positive correlation between the number of uses of library services and academic achievement for undergraduate students?”. <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-1) \n",

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "We hypothesize that California counties with higher rates of activity and participation in public libraries correlate positively with higher CAASPP (California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress) test scores in both ELA and mathematics. Children who regularly visit libraries  have more exposure to reading, routine studying, tutoring, and community events that are often held by libraries. We hypothesize that this would result in those children having stronger reading comprehension and understanding of other skills that lead to them scoring higher on California standardized tests than those who don’t."

    "\n",
    "Link to the dataset: https://www.library.ca.gov/stats/?pageNo=1 \n",
    "\n",
    "Number of observations: 6 years (2016-2022), 184-186 libraries (observations) each\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of variables: Before wrangling, 119 variables. After wrangling, we should have 9: 'County', 'Population of The Legal Service Area', 'Registered Users as of June 30', 'Children Borrowers', 'Library Visits', 'Total Operating Income', 'Circulation of Childrens Materials', \"# of Children's Programs\", \"Children's Program Attendance\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important variables we will use to determine the rate of school-aged children’s activity in libraries are Children Borrowers and Circulation of Children’s Materials. Children borrowers are those who are registered with the library with a child/youth library card, but specific age can vary by library system. Circulation of Children’s Materials refers to the total circulation (including renewals) of cataloged and uncataloged materials (in all formats) marked as Children's, whether they are borrowed by a child, young adult, or adult over the course of the report year. We will calculate the borrowers and circulation per 1,000 children in the county using the population of children in each county using Dataset #3 (see below).\n",

    "Number of observations: 8 years (2014 - 2023, missing data from 2019-2020), ~101,000 observations in the score dataset (each observation is a grade in a school), ~11,000 observations in the school names dataset (each observation is a school). We will be using data from grades 3 through 8, excluding grade 11 because the age range falls outside the Children Borrowers’ age range from the Library dataset. This dataset includes CAASPP data from charter and non-charter schools, both of which will be included in our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of variables: Before wrangling, 33 variables. After wrangling, we should have 10: 'County Code', 'School Code', 'Test Year', ‘Test ID’, 'Total Tested with Scores', 'Mean Scale Score', 'Percentage Standard Exceeded', 'Percentage Standard Met', 'Percentage Standard Nearly Met', 'Percentage Standard Not Met'\n",
    "\n",
    "We will primarily be focusing on the Mean Scale Scores for the ELA and the Mathematics assessments as it represents the average score across all content areas on the exam for each grade but will use the Percentage Standard data to go deeper with our analysis. A Test ID of 1 or 2 corresponds to the ELA or the Mathematics assessments respectively. The CAASPP website provides definitions of what each standard level means and how the percentages met were calculated on [this](https://caaspp-elpac.ets.org/caaspp/UnderstandingSBResults#am1) page and how the Mean Scale Score was calculated and what the ranges for each grade is [here](https://caaspp-elpac.ets.org/caaspp/ScaleScoreRangesSB).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each year has two files, one for score data by school and grade, and one that matches school codes with the school names. We will combine these two sets for each year so that the scores are identifiable by county name rather than code. We plan to combine the observations for each dataset (Libraries and CAASPP) so that each one year has 58 observations for the 58 California counties. Then, we will combine the Library and CAASPP data into one dataset where each observation is one year in each county. Each observation would include the variables from both the library dataset and the CAASPP dataset. \n",

    "We will primarily use the total number of children aged 5-13 per county within this dataset and the 'Children Borrowers' and the 'Circulation of Childrens Materials' columns from Dataset #1 to calculate the proportion of borrowers and circulated materials per 1,000 children. \n",
    "\n",
    "A potential confounding variable we discovered is that not all children who go to the library take the CAASPP tests, such as if they are homeschooled."
